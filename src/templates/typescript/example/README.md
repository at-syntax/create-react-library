# {{%=PACKAGE_NAME%}} TypeScript Example

This is a TypeScript React application that demonstrates how to use the `{{%=PACKAGE_NAME%}}` library with full type safety.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## What's Included

This TypeScript example demonstrates:

- **Type-safe component usage** with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Props validation** using the exported `MyComponentProps` interface
- **Type-safe event handling** with proper function signatures
- **Custom component composition** with TypeScript support
- **IntelliSense support** for better development experience

## TypeScript Features Demonstrated

- Importing and using component interfaces (`MyComponentProps`)
- Creating custom components with proper typing
- Type-safe event handlers and callbacks
- Proper JSX element typing
- Interface composition and extension

## Learn More

- Check out the main library documentation in the parent directory
- Explore the TypeScript definitions in `lib/index.d.ts` after building
- Modify `src/App.tsx` to experiment with different usage patterns
- Add your own typed components to see how they integrate with the library

## Development Tips

- Use VS Code or another TypeScript-aware editor for the best experience
- The library's TypeScript definitions will be available after running `npm run build` in the parent directory
- Take advantage of auto-completion and type checking during development
